We can switch to this whenever you want even more functionality.

No local services. No dependencies. No complexity.

Just simple, beautiful photo uploads that work everywhere! 🐕📸

*P.S. The storage bucket creation is the only manual step because it requires admin access to your Supabase project. Everything else is automated and ready to go!*
